# Programming Techniques

Homework assignments solutions for Programming Techniques course.

1. Topological sorts: A recursive program that generates ALL the topological sorts. It outputs the number of topsorts generated and outputs only the first 50 of the topsorts generated.
2. Maximum Subsequence Sum/Product: 
      - Mss4 is a linear program which outputs the maximum subsequence sum. It also outputs the first and last position of the maximum sum.
      - Mssp contains a recursive and linear algorithms for finding the maximum subsequence product in a array.
